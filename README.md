# Oxon-HERC-Applied-Methods-in-Cost-effectiveness-Analysis

"Analytic methods of economic evaluation are applied in health care to address the fundamental economic question of how to allocate scarce health care resources to maximise health gain. This course teaches the latest methods for performing a cost-effectiveness analysis."

These are my lectures in Excel and TreeAge. Index numbers indicate topics in the order they were taught.

The 1-week course was delivered by the Health Economics Research Centre (HERC) at Oxford Univeristy (Oxon).
